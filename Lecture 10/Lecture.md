First, we go over quiz answers- I got all 3 T/F and the question on hwo to avoid overfitting. The objective function for linear regression I got hilariously wrong. This is the objective function of linear regression: $min_w \thinspace ||Y - Xw||_2$

*Negative log-likelihood function*: $\sum_{j=1}^n \{y_iw^Tx_i - log(1 + exp(w^T))}
