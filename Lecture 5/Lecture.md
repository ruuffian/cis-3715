I missed two days of classes, here is a summary-
- Visualizing data
- That's it
- I didn't miss anything.
- All the python techniques are in the slides.
Boxplot
- Boxplots are good!
- min, 25%, median, 75%, max
- Care for outliers, you want your min and max values to be outlier-free
Scatter Plots
- Can reveal correlations or dependencies in data
